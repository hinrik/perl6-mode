[![travis][badge-travis]][travis]

Perl 6 mode lets you edit Perl 6 code with [GNU Emacs][] 24.

This mode needs GNU Emacs 24.4.

## Features

* Basic syntax highlighting
* Basic indentation

#### Planned

* Complete syntax highlighting
* Better indentation support
* Help system
* REPL interaction
* imenu support
* ETags support
* `find-file-at-point` for module names
* Electricity (`electric-pair-mode` needs some context-sensitive help)

#### Not planned

* Syntax checking (use [flycheck-perl6][])

## Installation

With [`use-package`][use-package] in your init file:

```el
(use-package perl6-mode
  :ensure t
  :defer t)
```

Or in your [`Cask`][cask] file:

```el
(source melpa)

(depends-on "perl6-mode")
```
Or manually from [MELPA][] with <kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>
and <kbd>M-x package-install RET perl6-mode</kbd>.

## Usage

Just visit Perl 6 files.

The major mode will be autoloaded whenever a Perl 6 file is visited.
This includes any file with `perl6` in the shebang, as well as any file
with a `.p6`, `.pm6`, or `.pl6` extension. It also applies to any `.pm`,
`.pl`, and `.t` files whose first line of code looks like Perl 6.

Use <kbd>M-x customize-group RET perl6</kbd> to customize Perl 6 Mode.

## Support

You can ask a question in the [issue tracker][], or email me at
hinrik.sig@gmail.com.

## Contribute

Pull requests are welcome.

You might want to install [`cask`][cask] so you can run the test suite
(with `make test`).
