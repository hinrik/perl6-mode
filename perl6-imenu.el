;;; perl6-imenu.el --- Imenu support Perl 6 -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Imenu functions and variables are defined here.

;; Definition of "identifiers" (names) from
;;   https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Identifiers
;;
;; Identifiers are a grammatical building block that occur in several
;; places. An identifier is a primitive name, and must start with an
;; alphabetic character (or an underscore), followed by zero or more
;; word characters (alphabetic, underscore or number). You can also
;; embed dashes - or single quotes ' in the middle, but not two in a
;; row, and only if followed immediately by an alphabetic character.
;;
;; For NQP names, no embedded hyphens or single quotes are allowed.

;; Regex definitions:
